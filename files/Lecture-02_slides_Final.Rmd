## Pre-Lecture Recap  

- **Program Flow** or **Program Control Flow** is a swanky term for the order by which a set of instructions (i.e. code) gets interpreted in a computer program and by which they are executed.   

- This flow is determined at run time (e.g. opening a program or pressing ``Run`` in R Studio) by the input data and by any **Control Structures**

- *Functions* provide a means of modularizing a named sequence code or, routine (as pictured below), so that they can iteratively be used with different inputs and variable assignments without the need for extensive copying/pasting.  *Functions* typically have an output or *return a value*.

## Pre-Lecture Review

1. Let's revisit the function, *OneSDbelowMean* we discussed previously that calculates one standard deviation below the mean for a given numerical input.  Run *OneSDbelowMean* using the code below.  But, this time, **complete the function call using *x* instead of test** as the input to the function. 

X contains the ages of all patients represented in a curated version of the NEISS dataset.  

What value is returned by the function when you run the code?

```{r echo=TRUE}

library(neiss)                    #locad the curated data package
data(injuries)                    #load the dataset
names(injuries)

x <-injuries$age                  #define the variable

OneSDbelowMean<-function(x){      #define the function with x as input.  Inputs get put between ()s after function. 
  sdbelow<- mean(x)-sd(x)         #body of function
  return(sdbelow)                 #return statement
}

OneSDbelowMean(x)                 #Line you need to modify - function call 

```

### Plotting Checking to See if Our Answer Makes Sense

It's always a good idea to see if your ouput makes sense.  Visualizations can help with this and there are a number of basic plots that can help.  One choice is a **boxplot**.

**Boxplots show us the range of the data and highlight the median.  Let's take a look.

```{r echo=TRUE}

x <-injuries$age     #define the variable
boxplot(x)
```

  
## Writing Functions with default values

If we run the pre-lecture question code without giving *OneSDBelowMean* an input, we get an error:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

library(neiss)                    #locad the curated data package
data(injuries)                    #load the dataset
names(injuries)

x <-injuries$age                  #define the variable

OneSDbelowMean<-function(x){      #define the function with x as input.  Inputs get put between ()s after function. 
  sdbelow<- mean(x)-sd(x)         #body of function
  return(sdbelow)                 #return statement
}

OneSDbelowMean()                 #Line you need to modify - function call 

```

### Setting a default value

Now let's try this again, but for troubleshooting, we'll input 0 into the function...

```{r echo=TRUE}

#library(neiss)                    #locad the curated data package
#data(injuries)                    #load the dataset
#names(injuries)

x <-injuries$age                  #define the variable


OneSDbelowMean<-function(x=0){      #define the function with x as input.  Inputs get put between ()s after function. 
  sdbelow<- mean(x)-sd(x)         #body of function
  return(sdbelow)                 #return statement
}

OneSDbelowMean()                

```

## Scope: Sharing data between functions and variables

**Scope** refers to how visible a variable is to a function or to your program at large.

- To illustrate, What value of $\texttt{test}$ is output by the code below?

```{r eval= FALSE, echo=TRUE}

library(neiss)                    #load the curated data package
data(injuries)                    #load the dataset
names(injuries)

x <-injuries$age                  #define the variable
y <- c(0,1)

OneSDbelowMean<-function(x=0){      #define the function with x as input.  Inputs get put between ()s after function. 
  # x <- c(y,x)
  y <- c(y,1)
  
  sdbelow<- mean(x)-sd(x)         #body of function
  
  return(sdbelow)                 #return statement
}
OneSDbelowMean()
#test <- sdbelow                 #Line you need to modify - function call 
#test
y
```

### Scope: What happened?

  - R separates functions and associates variables inside the function in a separate environment from the rest of our code
  
  - An environment is a data structure that maps names to values stored elswhere in memory   

  - Variables created outside of functions are stored to the global environment
  
  - Options for assigning variables to environments and sourcing functions in R

## Conditionals: Making decisions to direct program flow 


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='30%'}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics('D:/Work/CFProg/Courses/BMI713_2020/Lecture 2/lecture-02_figures/ConditionalFlowChart.jpg')
```

## Conditionals: Some examples 
```{r echo=TRUE}
y<-injuries$age                            #extract data
set.seed(1)                                       #so we all get the same case
one_case<-y[sample(1:length(y),1,replace=TRUE)]   #randomly pick a case 

isYoung <- function(one_case, y) {                   #function with conditionals
  if (one_case > mean(y)+sd(y)) {                 #note use of {}'s
    return(0)
  } else if (one_case< mean(y)-sd(y)) {          #note else if requires an                                                        arguement
    return(1)
  } else {                                        #else does not
    return(-1)
  }
}

mean(y)
sd(y)
one_case
isYoung(one_case,y)
```


## More on conditionals  


  - Addtional comparisons:  greater than or equal to $(>=)$, less than or equal to $(<=)$, and not equal to $(!=)$.
    - Comparisons can also be combined with $&&$, which symbolizes logical "and". A vertical bar, $||$, which symbolizes logical "or". 
    - Vectorized operations apply to multiple values and include:
      - Or: $|$
      - And: $&$
      - Equality: $==$
      - Can be collapsed to one value with $\texttt{any()}$ or $\texttt{all()}$

## Conditionals are useful for checking values

  - What would the output of this code be? 
  
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

y<-injuries$age                                #extract data
set.seed(5)                                         #so we all get the same case
pick_case1<-y[sample(1:length(y),1,replace=TRUE)]   #randomly pick a case 
pick_case1
pick_case2<-y[sample(1:length(y),2,replace=TRUE)]
pick_case2
case_mean <- function(pick_case1, pick_case2) {                  
  if (length(pick_case1) != length(pick_case2)){                 
    stop("case '1' and '2' must be the same length", call. = FALSE)
  } 
  sum(pick_case1*pick_case2)/sum(pick_case1)
}
case_mean(pick_case1,pick_case2)  
```
  

## Conditionals: ifelse example 

```{r echo=TRUE}

y<-injuries$age                                #extract data
BeyondOneSD <- ifelse(y > mean(y)+sd(y),y,NA)
 
```

## Conditionals: Logical Subsetting
  - You can also accomplish much of the functionality of conditionals with subsetting:
  
  - Data frames share characteristics of lists and matrices and can be subset in either way with some differences
  
```{r echo=TRUE}

y<-injuries$age                               #extract data w/$
y_matrix <- injuries[,3]                      #extract data with matrix                                                       subsetting
y_list <- injuries[["age"]]                   #extract data w/list subsetting
 
BeyondOneSD <- y[y > mean(y)+sd(y) & y < mean(y)+(2*sd(y))]
LessOneSD <- y[y < mean(y)-sd(y)]
head(BeyondOneSD)
head(LessOneSD)

```

## Conditionals: Switches

  - Useful to replace long chains of if statements:

```{r echo=TRUE}
y<-injuries$age
stats <- function(y, calc) {
switch(calc,
         mean = mean(y),
         median = median(y),
         stdev = sd(y)
)
}
stats(y, "mean")
```

### Checking the results: Plot a histogram

```{r echo=TRUE}
y<-injuries$age
hist(y, xlab="Age", ylab="Frequency [cases]")
```


## For Loops: Iterating or repeating portions of code 


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='30%'}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics('D:/Work/CFProg/Courses/BMI713_2020/Lecture 2/lecture-02_figures/Loop.jpg')
```

## For Loops: Basic building blocks {.smaller .build}

- Output
- Sequence
- Body
- Example:

```{r echo=T}

x<-data.frame(age=injuries$age,weight=injuries$weight)                      #subset of dataset

results<- vector("double",ncol(x))  #allocate output vector (!important to do this before loop)
for (ii in seq_along(x)){           #seq of for loop
  results[[ii]] <-median(x[[ii]])     #loop body
}
results
boxplot(x)
```

## Loop alternatives: apply

- Family of related functions, including $\texttt{apply()}$, $\texttt{sapply()}$, $\texttt{lapply()}$
- Example:

```{r echo=TRUE}

x<-data.frame(age=injuries$age,weight=injuries$weight)    #subset of dataset
results<- apply(x,2,mean)           #note: requires 3 arguments
results
```
